classdef SwerveDrivePoseEstimator < handle

    %*%
    % This class wraps @link SwerveDriveOdometry Swerve Drive Odometryend to fuse latency-compensated
    % vision measurements with swerve drive encoder distance measurements. It is intended to be a
    % drop-in replacement for @link edu.wpi.first.math.kinematics.SwerveDriveOdometryend.
    %
    % <p>@link SwerveDrivePoseEstimator#updateend should be called every robot loop.
    %
    % <p>@link SwerveDrivePoseEstimator#addVisionMeasurementend can be called as infrequently as you
    % want; if you never call it, then this class will behave as regular encoder odometry.
